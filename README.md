## Objective
In this lab, you will explore the fundamentals of arrays in JavaScript, including how to declare arrays, access and manipulate their elements using methods, iterate through arrays, and destructure them. By the end of this lab, you should be able to work with arrays effectively and understand their common use cases in programming.

## Step 1: Declaring Arrays
### Task:
- Declare an array that stores a list of at least 5 elements (numbers, strings, or a combination).
- Use the correct syntax for creating arrays in JavaScript (i.e., brackets `[]`).

### Expected Outcome:
You should have an array that stores multiple items, demonstrating the ability to initialize an array with different types of data.

## Step 2: Accessing Arrays
### Task:
- Access the first, last, and middle elements of your declared array.
- Store these accessed values in separate variables.

### Hint:
- Array indexing starts at 0. To access the last element, use the array’s length property.

### Expected Outcome:
You should be able to retrieve specific elements from the array and understand how indexing works, including the use of array length.

## Step 3: Using Array Properties
### Task:
- Use the `.length` property to determine the number of elements in your array and log the result to the console.

### Expected Outcome:
You should understand how to use the length property to find out the size of any array.

## Step 4: Array Methods
### Task:
- Experiment with at least three array methods such as `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.shift()`, `.unshift()`, or `.splice()`.
- Add new elements, remove an element, and modify an element in place using these methods.

### Hint:
- Modify your array at both the beginning and the end, and log your array after each operation to observe changes.

### Expected Outcome:
You should be familiar with how to add, remove, or modify elements in an array using JavaScript’s array methods.

## Step 5: Iterating Through Arrays
### Task:
- Write a loop to iterate through all elements in the array to perform actions on them.
